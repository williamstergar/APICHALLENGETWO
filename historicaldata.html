    <h1>Price Data for April 13th, 2021</h1>
    <p> Below this paragraph you will see the price data for all 385 cryptocurrencies on April 13th, 2021. This was the day when Bitcoin (BTC) wicked into an all time high and began its descent back down to $28,820 for a 55% correction. At this stage in the game, most cryptocurrencies will follow Bitcoin's trend; whether BTC goes up or down, the majority of 'altcoins' will mirror that of Bitcoin. In the future, we will see this behavior gradually change as BTC's market dominance decreases. Regardless, the all time highs listed below will be broken again this year as we are still in a bull market. </p>
